Although I haven't ported over other logos yet, it is relatively easy to do so. 
Just remember that every line should have equal length, otherwise it's going to fail. 
Multicolor Logos are a bit harder to do, see mint.h as an example. It's best to start with a normal no color Logo and then add the coloring, to preserver spacing
